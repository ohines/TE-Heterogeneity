# TE-Heterogeneity
 
The purpose of this repository is to make recent tools for understanding treatment effect heterogeneity more accessible. This first commit contains R code for average treatment effect (ATE) and variance of treatment effect estimation (VTE), using both one-step bias correction, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE).

Example code is given in the file `R\Example.R`.
